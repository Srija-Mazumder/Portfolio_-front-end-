Portfolio website
Welcome to my portfolio website! This is my first major project as I embark on my journey to learn web development. The site is a showcase of my skills and projects, created using HTML and CSS. Iâ€™ve drawn knowledge from a variety of resources to build this project, and I'm excited to present my work to the world.
HTML: The backbone of the website, providing structure and semantic meaning to the content.
CSS: Used for styling and layout, including responsive design techniques and animations.

The purpose of this portfolio website is to provide a comprehensive showcase of my projects, skills, and professional background. It serves as an online resume and a central point for potential employers and collaborators to learn more about me and my work.

Features-
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and works well on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop monitors.
Interactive Navbar: A navbar that directs to the particular section of the page as wanted by user.
Project Showcase: A dedicated section to display my future projects with descriptions and links.
Contact Form: A simple and effective footer to show contact details to visitors.

Future Enhancements
JavaScript Integration: Adding JavaScript to enhance interactivity, such as form validation and dynamic content.
Additional Projects: Continuously updating the site with new projects and skills.
Backend Support: Integrating backend technologies like Node.js to add features like a guestbook or a blog.
